## Purpose

I have built this website to exhibit my HTML and CSS abilities, therefore some buttons are only placeholders and don't do any functions.

## Build Steps

1. Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:your-username/portfolio.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd portfolio
3. Open the index.html through windows explorer or VS code Live Server.

## Features

- You can have a taste of good old Windows XP's UI again!
- There are 3 apps on the desktop that you can choose from including notepad, gmail (not functional), and photos app.
- When you open the apps you can drag them by clicking on the top ribbon.

## Future Goals

- Adding more functionalities to the apps.
- Adding a calculator app.

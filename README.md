<h1> ðŸ‘” Fake Windows XP ðŸ‘—</h1>
<p>This is a simulation of Windows XP user interface to exhibit my vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS abilities. There is a start menu and 3 applications that the user can choose from. My focus in this project was on the UI, therefore some buttons and icons are merely placeholders and do not have functionality.</p>
